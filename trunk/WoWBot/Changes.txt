WoWBot 12a

Changes
* Fixed typo in movetoobject (eqjoe).
* Added Durability check to trigger run to merchant. You can set if you want to auto repair and at what level in the config file. The function to check if you need to repair is done when your resurrect and should be called from your downtime function too.
* Will now auto disable selling if your still full after visiting merchant (will still repair though if needed).
* Added switch to General Options to disable complex targeting if desired for a faster Target routine. This will stop the target routine from checking if units could bring adds when you pull.
* Added switch to Pathing Options to turn off fast face this does mean if its a tight turn your bot will stop to turn which may look just as 'bot like' as face -fast looks suspicious but you cant have it both ways :)
* Added very basic hunter example Routines.iss to demonstrate how you can use the Min and Max ranged values added to the config file.

* Added check to prevent going into LOOT state if you have aggro.

* Removed RunHome from Settings File as its no longer used.
* Upped frequency of auto generated waypoints to every 10 when making Paths with WoWBotPather.
* Changed all Face command to use the SmartFace function. This should make it easier to tune face if your having problems.

* Changed the example Downtime function to use the MinHealth and MinMana values stored in the configuration file.
* Added check for aggro on your pet in the CheckAggro function (kras).
* Added auto creation of realm and character directories.

WoWBot alpha 11a

Changes:
* Added check to spell casting to show error in the log if you try to cast a spell you dont have and avoid dumping the script.

WoWBot alpha 11

Changes:
* Fixed bug in FindTarget meaning aggros close together were not being avoided.
* Changed CastSpell so you no longer have to supply a target and it will always stop you moving whilst it casts. If the spell is a targetable one like a buff or heal and no target is supplied it assumes the target is itself. As a consequence there will be no more target switching within CastSpell. If you WANT to switch targets then you can use TargetAndCastSpell instead. If you WANT to not stop moving if its an instacast then use CastOnRun instead.
* Removed the RestUp function from Routines.iss and all references to call it.
* Added 2 new functions to Routines.iss CombatPrep and Downtime.  Combat prep gets called once you have a target but before you actually start to attack it and Downtime gets called once combat is over and before you loot.
* Added check to FindTarget to avoid targetting your own pets, totems etc.
* Removed IsCaster and all checks that use it since it was largely useless now that RestUp has been removed.
* Shrunk the status window and added a background.

* Moved config files and routines file around to better support multiple characters and realms. all character specific stuff now goes into a folder like this /WoWBot/<Realm Name>/<Character Name>. In here you put your character specific routines file now just called routines.iss, IventoryManagement.xml, FoodNDrink.xml, a WoWBot_<Character Name>.xml will be automatically created in here along with any path file generated by WoWBotPath.iss.
* Added Aggro check to Attack function in Routines.iss to take care of aggros whikst your advancing to your target.(astyrfan)

Changes:
* Added hud message update to cast spell routine
* Added FoodNDrink.xml config file. The Eat and Drink function will look down the list and consume the first item they come too. If you want to change the priority then just put yor prefered food or drink higher up the list. There is no need to keep the key names in numeric order so long as you do not duplicate them.
* Streamlined FindTarget routine.
* Added GUIDBlacklist for keeping a list of bad target mobs.
